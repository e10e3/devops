# Conclusion

A lot of things would have been faster if I had hard-written the
configuration, and not had to use environment variables to set it. But
at the end, I have the satisfaction of a well-tended project.

All in all we did created Docker containers, created a CI/CD workflow
for them, fixed linting errors, and deployed the project on a server
with Ansible.
